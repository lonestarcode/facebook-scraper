Kafka in this project is used as a message broker to facilitate communication between the different microservices. While Kafka is commonly used in financial services, it's widely adopted across various industries for many use cases beyond finance.

In the Facebook Marketplace scraper project, Kafka serves several key purposes:

1. **Decoupling services**: The scraper, processor, API, and notification services communicate asynchronously via Kafka topics without direct dependencies.

2. **Data streaming**: When the scraper discovers marketplace listings, it publishes them to a Kafka topic (like `raw_listings`), which the processor service consumes for further processing.

3. **Reliable message delivery**: Kafka provides guarantees that messages won't be lost even if a service goes down temporarily.

4. **Scalability**: Multiple instances of each service can process messages in parallel from Kafka topics.

Some specific Kafka use cases in this project:
- The scraper publishes raw listings to the `raw_listings` topic
- The processor consumes from `raw_listings`, enriches the data, and publishes to `processed_listings`
- The notification service listens on the `alerts` topic to send emails and SMS when matching listings are found

Kafka is popular for any application requiring reliable, high-throughput message processing - not just finance. It's particularly valuable in microservice architectures like this one.
